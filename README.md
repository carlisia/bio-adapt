# Bio-Adapt

**Bio-inspired adaptive systems for Go** - Self-organizing coordination patterns that achieve goals despite disruptions.

## Overview

Bio-Adapt brings biological intelligence principles to distributed systems. Just as cells self-organize to heal wounds or regenerate limbs, your systems can adaptively coordinate to maintain desired states even when disrupted.

Inspired by Dr. Michael Levin's bioelectric research showing how cellular networks achieve reliable outcomes through goal-directed behavior rather than fixed instruction sequences.

## Key Benefits

üéØ **Goal-Directed** - Systems pursue target states, not rigid procedures
üîÑ **Self-Healing** - Automatic recovery from disruptions
‚ö° **Emergent Coordination** - No central orchestrator needed
üß¨ **Biologically Inspired** - Proven patterns from nature

## Core Patterns

### üß≤ Attractor Basin Synchronization

**Package:** `emerge`
**Use Case:** Coordinate timing across distributed workloads
**Example:** Batch LLM API calls naturally without central control

### ‚ö° Morphospace Navigation

**Package:** `bioelectric` _(coming soon)_
**Use Case:** Dynamic resource allocation around bottlenecks
**Example:** Reroute processing when nodes fail

### üîó Cognitive Glue Networks

**Package:** `glue` _(coming soon)_
**Use Case:** Emergent consensus through collective problem-solving
**Example:** Distributed schema evolution

## When to Use Bio-Adapt

‚úÖ **Perfect for:**

- Systems with 100+ concurrent workloads needing coordination
- API rate limiting and request batching
- Self-healing distributed systems
- Workload synchronization without central control
- Natural load balancing across resources

‚ùå **Not ideal for:**

- Systems requiring strict deterministic guarantees
- Simple request-response patterns
- Tightly coupled synchronous operations

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt
cd bio-adapt

# Build and run examples
task build:examples
task run:example -- llm_batching
```

```go
// Synchronize workloads naturally
import "github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/emerge"

// Define target state
goal := emerge.State{
    Phase:     0,                      // Alignment point
    Frequency: 200 * time.Millisecond, // Batch window
    Coherence: 0.9,                    // 90% sync target
}

// Create self-organizing swarm
swarm, _ := emerge.NewSwarm(20, goal)
swarm.Run(ctx)
```
