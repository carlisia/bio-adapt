# Bio-adapt

Goal-directed coordination for concurrent and distributed systems, inspired by biological intelligence.

Drawing from [Dr. Michael Levin](https://grokkingtech.io/people/michael-levin)'s research on how biological systems reliably achieve goals through multiple pathways, bio-adapt brings these principles to software systems‚Äîfrom single-process concurrency to distributed architectures.

**What:** Goal-directedness, adaptive pathfinding, collective intelligence  
**How:** Decentralized algorithms that pursue goals through multiple strategies

**Why:** Instead of programming HOW (procedures), you program WHAT (goals). Go goroutines figure out the HOW through:

- Emerge: Finding when to coordinate (temporal synchronization)
- Navigate: Finding what resources to use (resource allocation)
- Glue: Finding how things work (collective understanding)

## Quick start

```bash
go get github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt
```

```go
import "github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/emerge"

// Create goal-directed swarm that pursues synchronization target
target := emerge.State{
    Frequency: 200 * time.Millisecond, // Target coordination interval
    Coherence: 0.9,                    // Goal: 90% synchronization
}
swarm, _ := emerge.NewSwarm(20)
swarm.AchieveSynchronization(ctx, target) // Pursues goal through multiple strategies
```

## Features

üéØ **Goal-directed** - Systems maintain target states as invariants, finding alternative paths when defaults fail  
üîÑ **Multiple pathways** - Inspired by how biological systems reach goals despite perturbations  
‚ö° **Emergent coordination** - Collective intelligence without central control  
üß¨ **Bio-inspired principles** - Computational primitives derived from Levin's research on adaptive biological systems

## Coordination primitives

Bio-adapt provides three complementary primitives for system coordination:

### üß≤ [Emerge](docs/emerge/primitive.md) - Goal-directed synchronization

**Status:** ‚úÖ Production-ready

Systems (concurrent or distributed) that converge on target coordination states through multiple pathways, inspired by how biological systems reliably achieve morphological goals.

- Temporal coordination (when agents act)
- Self-organizing synchronization
- Adaptive strategy switching

### ‚ö° [Navigate](docs/navigate/primitive.md) - Goal-directed resource allocation

**Status:** üöß Coming soon

Systems that navigate resource configuration spaces to reach target allocations via multiple paths, adapting when direct routes are blocked.

- Dynamic resource allocation (what resources to use)
- Alternative path discovery
- Constraint-aware navigation

### üîó [Glue](docs/glue/primitive.md) - Goal-directed collective intelligence

**Status:** üìã Planned

Collective goal-seeking enables independent agents to converge on shared understanding through local interactions, achieving insights no individual could reach alone.

- Schema discovery (how APIs work)
- Distributed hypothesis testing
- Emergent consensus

See [primitives overview](docs/primitives.md) for detailed comparison.

## Use cases

- **API batching** - Goal: minimize API calls; emerge finds optimal coordination timing
- **Multi-agent synchronization** - Goal: achieve coherence; multiple strategies ensure convergence
- **Self-healing systems** - Goal: maintain service levels; alternative paths when failures occur
- **Load balancing** - Goal: optimal resource usage; navigate finds best allocation paths

Perfect for systems that need to maintain goals despite disruptions, with 100+ agents requiring coordination.

## Performance

The emerge primitive is optimized for production with 1000+ agents:

- **Sub-linear convergence** - Better performance at scale
- **~2KB memory per agent** - Efficient resource usage
- **<1ms convergence latency** - Fast coordination
- **Automatic optimization** - Adapts storage strategy by swarm size

See [emerge optimization guide](docs/emerge/optimization.md) for details.

## Research foundation

Inspired by [Dr. Michael Levin](https://grokkingtech.io/people/michael-levin)'s research on goal-directedness in biological systems, where cells and tissues achieve target morphologies through multiple pathways despite perturbations.

Key concepts adapted:

- **Goal-directedness** - Systems that maintain target states as invariants
- **Multiple pathways** - Alternative routes to achieve the same outcome
- **Collective intelligence** - Problem-solving that emerges from local interactions
- **Adaptive navigation** - Finding new solutions when defaults are blocked

Implementation foundations:

- Kuramoto model for synchronization dynamics (emerge)
- Pathfinding algorithms for resource navigation (navigate)
- Distributed consensus protocols for collective intelligence (glue)
