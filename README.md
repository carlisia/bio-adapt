# Bio-Adapt

A bio-inspired adaptive system framework in Go.

It employs resilient orchestration patterns for distributed Go systems inspired by Dr. Michael Levin's bioelectric research on cellular intelligence and regeneration.

## What It Does

bio-adapt implements goal-directed coordination patterns that enable distributed systems to achieve and maintain target states even under disruption, much like biological cells adaptively self-organize toward correct anatomical outcomes when typical pathways are blocked.

It treats desired states as invariants and dynamically explores alternate execution paths to reach them.

By leveraging Goâ€™s concurrency primitives, bio-adapt uses principles of biological intelligence to enable systems that pursue goals and reroute intelligently when conditions change.

## Core Patterns

- **Morphospace Navigation (bioelectric)**: Dynamic resource allocation that reroutes around bottlenecks
- **Attractor Basin Synchronization (attractor)**: Rhythmic coordination that self-corrects disruptions
- **Cognitive Glue Networks (glue)**: Emergent consensus through collective problem-solving

## When to Use

- Scaling beyond 1000+ concurrent agents accessing shared resources
- Coordinating periodic tasks without thundering herds
- Adapting to schema changes without brittle contracts
- Building self-healing distributed systems

See the `examples/` directory for usage examples.

## Inspired By

Based on the groundbreaking bioelectric research of Dr. Michael Levin at Tufts University, showing how cellular networks achieve reliable outcomes through goal-directed behavior rather than fixed instruction sequences.
