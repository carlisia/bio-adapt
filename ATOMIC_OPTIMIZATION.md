# Atomic Field Grouping Optimization

## Overview

Reduced cache line bouncing by grouping frequently accessed atomic fields together, achieving **60% performance improvement** for field access operations.

## Problem

The original Agent implementation used 6 separate atomic fields:
- `atomic.Float64` for phase, energy, localGoal, influence, stubbornness
- `atomic.Duration` for frequency

Each atomic operation can cause cache line bouncing between CPU cores, especially in high-concurrency scenarios with 1000+ agents.

## Solution

### Grouped Atomic Fields

Instead of separate atomics, group related fields that are often accessed together:

```go
// Before: 6 separate atomic operations
phase := agent.phase.Load()
energy := agent.energy.Load()
agent.phase.Store(newPhase)
agent.energy.Store(newEnergy)

// After: 2 atomic operations for all fields
state := agent.state.Load()  // Gets phase, energy, localGoal, frequency
phase := state.Phase
energy := state.Energy
agent.state.Update(func(s *AtomicState) {
    s.Phase = newPhase
    s.Energy = newEnergy
})
```

### Implementation Details

1. **AtomicState** - Groups frequently accessed fields:
   - Phase, Energy, LocalGoal, Frequency
   - Accessed together during updates and coherence calculations

2. **AtomicBehavior** - Groups behavioral parameters:
   - Influence, Stubbornness
   - Changed less frequently

3. **Atomic Operations**:
   - Uses `unsafe.Pointer` with CAS for lock-free updates
   - Falls back to simple load/store for low-contention scenarios

## Performance Results

### Field Access Benchmark
| Operation | Standard (6 atomics) | Grouped (2 atomics) | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Read 3 fields + Write 2 | 73.70 ns/op | 27.97 ns/op | **62% faster** |
| Allocations | 0 | 2 (for CAS) | Acceptable trade-off |

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Cache Line Bouncing**: 
   - From 6 potential cache line transfers to 2
   - Better CPU cache utilization

2. **Atomic Consistency**:
   - Multiple fields updated atomically together
   - No intermediate states visible to other threads

3. **Improved Locality**:
   - Related data stays together in memory
   - Better prefetching by CPU

## Usage

The optimization is transparent when using the AtomicOptimizedAgent:

```go
// Automatically used for very large swarms (future work)
agent := NewAtomicOptimized("agent-1")

// All operations work the same
phase := agent.Phase()
agent.SetPhase(newPhase)
agent.UpdateContext()
```

## Trade-offs

1. **Memory**: Small allocation overhead (64 bytes) per update in CAS loop
2. **Complexity**: Slightly more complex implementation
3. **Granularity**: Can't update single fields without touching others

## When to Use

- Swarms with 1000+ agents
- High-frequency updates (>1000 updates/sec)
- Multi-core systems where cache coherency matters
- Production deployments with performance SLAs

## Future Work

1. Integration with swarm for automatic selection based on size
2. Further grouping of Context fields
3. SIMD optimizations for batch operations
4. Lock-free data structures for extreme scale
