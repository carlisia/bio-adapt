# Glue architecture

## Overview

The glue package implements cognitive networks for emergent consensus through binding mechanisms inspired by neural synchronization. This pattern enables collective problem-solving and decision-making without central coordinators, similar to how the brain integrates distributed information into coherent perceptions.

## Core concepts

### Cognitive binding

Distributed information becomes unified through synchronized binding, creating coherent collective states from fragmented local knowledge. Like neural assemblies binding features into unified perceptions.

### Binding dynamics

The system models cognitive binding using simplified neural synchronization:

```
dφ/dt = ω + Σ(K_ij × B_ij × sin(φ_j - φ_i)) + η(t)
```

Where:

- φ = cognitive phase
- ω = intrinsic frequency
- K_ij = coupling strength
- B_ij = binding affinity
- η(t) = cognitive noise

### Hierarchical goals

Multi-level objective structures:

- **Local goals** - Individual agent objectives
- **Group goals** - Cluster-level consensus
- **Global goals** - System-wide alignment
- **Meta goals** - Emergent purposes

## Agent implementation (conceptual)

### Cognitive components

Each cognitive agent will maintain:

- **Cognitive state** - Current mental representation
- **Binding strength** - Connection to assemblies
- **Attention focus** - Current processing priority
- **Memory trace** - Contribution to collective memory

### Binding mechanisms

- **Feature binding** - Unite related information
- **Temporal binding** - Synchronize across time
- **Spatial binding** - Connect distributed locations
- **Semantic binding** - Link by meaning

### Cognitive operations

Agents perform:

- Attention allocation
- Memory formation
- Inference steps
- Decision contributions

## Network coordination

### Consensus process

1. **Problem presentation** - Distribute information
2. **Attention focusing** - Agents attend to aspects
3. **Binding formation** - Related info connects
4. **Assembly emergence** - Coherent groups form
5. **Consensus crystallization** - Agreement emerges
6. **Decision execution** - Collective action

### Assembly formation

Neural assemblies for different functions:

- **Perception assemblies** - Process inputs
- **Memory assemblies** - Store information
- **Decision assemblies** - Make choices
- **Action assemblies** - Execute plans

### Hierarchical processing

```

## Cognitive strategies (planned)

### Attention-based consensus

Focus collective attention on key issues:

```go
// Conceptual API
network := glue.NewNetwork(100, glue.State{
    AttentionCapacity: 10,
    BindingThreshold: 0.7,
})
consensus := network.FocusOn(issue)
```

### Distributed inference

Collective reasoning through binding:

```go
// Conceptual API
inference := glue.NewInferenceEngine(network)
conclusion := inference.Reason(premises)
```

### Emergent creativity

Novel solutions through cognitive recombination:

```go
// Conceptual API
creative := glue.NewCreativeNetwork(network)
solution := creative.Generate(problem)
```

## Performance characteristics (projected)

### Expected scalability

| Network size | Binding time | Consensus time | Memory/agent |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| 10-30        | ~100ms       | ~500ms         | ~16KB        |
| 30-100       | ~500ms       | ~2s            | ~12KB        |
| 100-1000     | ~2s          | ~10s           | ~8KB         |

### Cognitive complexity

| Operation         | Complexity | Parallelizable |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Binding formation | O(k²)      | Partially      |
| Attention focus   | O(n log n) | Yes            |
| Memory recall     | O(log m)   | Yes            |
| Consensus         | O(n × k)   | Regional       |

## Use cases

### Distributed consensus

Agreement without voting:

```go
// Future API
network := glue.NewNetwork(30, glue.State{
    BindingStrength: 0.9,
    ConsensusThreshold: 0.8,
})
```

### Schema evolution

Collective data model updates:

```go
// Future API
evolution := glue.SchemaEvolution{
    CurrentSchema: existing,
    Constraints: rules,
}
newSchema := network.Evolve(evolution)
```

### Collective problem solving

Emergent solutions to complex problems:

```go
// Future API
problem := glue.Problem{
    Constraints: constraints,
    Objectives: goals,
}
solution := network.Solve(problem)
```
