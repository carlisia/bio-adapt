# Glue: Goal-Directed Collective Intelligence

**Collective intelligence through adaptive consensus** - Systems that pursue shared understanding via multiple pathways, switching strategies when defaults fail to achieve collective goals.

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned

## Overview

The glue package will implement cognitive binding mechanisms inspired by how the brain integrates distributed information into coherent perceptions and decisions. Like neural synchronization creates unified conscious experience from distributed processing, this package will enable distributed systems to achieve consensus and make collective decisions without central coordinators.

## Planned features

### Core mechanisms

- **Cognitive binding** - Unite distributed information
- **Hierarchical goals** - Multi-level objective alignment
- **Collective memory** - Shared state across network
- **Emergent decisions** - Consensus from local interactions

### Use cases

- **Distributed consensus** - Agreement without voting
- **Schema evolution** - Collective data model updates
- **Problem solving** - Emergent solutions to complex problems
- **Collective intelligence** - Group decision making

## Conceptual example

```go
// Future API (subject to change)
import "github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/glue"

// Create cognitive network for consensus
network := glue.NewNetwork(30, glue.State{
    BindingStrength: 0.9,    // Cognitive coupling
    Hierarchy: 3,             // Goal levels
    Threshold: 0.7,           // Decision threshold
})

// Nodes collectively solve problems
network.Run(ctx)
```

## Research foundation

Based on:

- Cognitive binding theory in neuroscience
- Neural synchronization and consciousness
- Collective intelligence in social insects
- Hierarchical predictive processing

## Current status

This package is in the planning phase. We're researching the best approaches to implement cognitive binding mechanisms for distributed systems.

## Contributing

We're especially interested in contributions from those with expertise in:

- Cognitive science and neuroscience
- Collective intelligence systems
- Consensus algorithms
- Multi-agent decision making
