# Goal-directed patterns

## Overview

Bio-adapt provides three complementary patterns for goal-directed distributed coordination, inspired by Michael Levin's research on how biological systems achieve reliable outcomes through multiple pathways. Each pattern enables systems to pursue specific goals despite disruptions, finding alternative routes when defaults fail.

## Available patterns

### ðŸ§² Emerge - Goal-directed synchronization

**Status:** Production-ready

Distributed systems that converge on target coordination states through multiple pathways. When one synchronization strategy fails, the system adaptively switches to alternatives, ensuring the goal is achieved.

**Core question:** "When should agents act?"

**Use cases:**

- API request batching (Goal: minimize API calls)
- Distributed task synchronization (Goal: achieve coherence)
- Load balancing (Goal: optimal distribution)
- Natural clustering (Goal: stable groupings)

**Key features:**

- Maintains synchronization goals as invariants
- Multiple strategies to achieve target states
- Adaptive strategy switching when stuck

### âš¡ Navigate - Goal-directed resource allocation

**Status:** Coming soon

Systems that navigate resource configuration spaces to reach target allocations via multiple paths. When direct routes are blocked by constraints or failures, the system discovers alternative paths to the same resource goals.

**Core question:** "What resources should agents use?"

**Planned use cases:**

- Dynamic rerouting around failures (Goal: maintain service levels)
- Adaptive resource allocation (Goal: optimal utilization)
- Constraint-aware distribution (Goal: meet all requirements)
- Multi-path resource discovery (Goal: find best allocation)

**Key features:**

- Navigates "morphospace" of resource configurations
- Discovers alternative paths when blocked
- Gradient-based optimization toward goals
- Memory of successful resource paths

### ðŸ”— Glue - Goal-directed collective intelligence

**Status:** Planned

Collective goal-seeking enables distributed agents to converge on shared understanding through local interactions. Agents collectively discover solutions that no individual could find alone.

**Core question:** "How does this system/API work?"

**Planned use cases:**

- Schema discovery (Goal: understand API contracts)
- Distributed consensus (Goal: agreement despite failures)
- Collective decision making (Goal: optimal group choices)
- Emergent problem solving (Goal: find solutions together)

**Key features:**

- Distributed hypothesis testing
- Collective knowledge building
- Consensus through local interactions
- Emergent understanding from partial observations

## Choosing a pattern

| Pattern      | Core Question              | Goal Type           | Maturity       |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| **Emerge**   | When should agents act?    | Temporal coordination | Production     |
| **Navigate** | What resources to use?     | Resource allocation | In development |
| **Glue**     | How does the API work?     | Collective understanding | Planned        |

## Combining patterns

These patterns can work together:

```go
// Example: Composing goal-directed patterns
import (
    "github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/emerge"
    "github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/navigate"
    "github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/glue"
)

// Goal: Minimize API calls through synchronized batching
batcher := emerge.NewSwarm(100)
batcher.AchieveSynchronization(ctx, batchingGoal)

// Goal: Optimal resource allocation despite constraints (future)
allocator := navigate.NewNavigator()
allocator.NavigateToTarget(ctx, resourceGoal)

// Goal: Discover API schema through collective intelligence (future)
network := glue.NewNetwork()
schema := network.SolveSchema(ctx, observations)
```

## Research foundation

All patterns are inspired by Michael Levin's research on goal-directedness in biological systems, where cells and tissues achieve target states through multiple pathways:

- **Emerge**: Goal-directed synchronization using attractor basins and the Kuramoto model
- **Navigate**: Goal-directed resource navigation through configuration spaces
- **Glue**: Goal-directed collective intelligence emerging from local interactions

**Key principle:** Systems that maintain goals as invariants and explore multiple solution paths are fundamentally more adaptive than those following fixed procedures.

## Getting started

Start with the production-ready emerge pattern:

```bash
go get github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt

# Run an example
go run github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/examples/emerge/basic_sync
```

Then explore the examples for each pattern as they become available.
