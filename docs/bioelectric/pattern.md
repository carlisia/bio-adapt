# Bioelectric package

**Status:** ðŸš§ Coming soon

**Morphospace navigation through bioelectric-inspired state propagation** - Dynamic resource allocation and adaptive routing inspired by bioelectric networks in biological development.

## Overview

The bioelectric package will implement voltage-like state propagation mechanisms inspired by Dr. Michael Levin's research on bioelectric networks in regeneration and development. Just as cells use bioelectric signals to coordinate large-scale anatomical decisions, this package enables distributed systems to dynamically route resources and adapt to changing conditions.

## Planned features

### Core mechanisms

- **Voltage potentials** - State represented as electrical potential
- **Gap junctions** - Direct state transfer between neighbors
- **Morphogenetic fields** - Large-scale pattern formation
- **Ion channels** - Controlled state flow regulation

### Use cases

- **Dynamic routing** - Reroute traffic around failures
- **Resource allocation** - Distribute compute/memory/bandwidth
- **State propagation** - Spread configuration changes
- **Developmental computing** - Grow computational structures

## Conceptual example

```go
// Future API (subject to change)
import "github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/bioelectric"

// Create bioelectric field for routing
field := bioelectric.NewField(100, bioelectric.State{
    Potential: 1.0,        // Initial voltage
    Conductance: 0.8,      // Gap junction strength
    Threshold: 0.5,        // Action potential trigger
})

// Nodes adapt routing based on potential gradients
field.Run(ctx)
```

## Research foundation

Based on:

- Michael Levin's work on bioelectric networks and regeneration
- Ion channel dynamics in cellular membranes
- Gap junction communication in tissue development
- Morphogenetic field theory

## Current status

This package is under active development. Core concepts are being refined and the API is being designed.
