# Navigate package

**Status:** ðŸš§ Coming soon

**Goal-directed resource allocation through adaptive pathfinding** - Systems that navigate resource configuration spaces to reach target allocations via multiple paths, adapting when direct routes are blocked.

## Overview

The navigate package will implement resource allocation through configuration space navigation, inspired by how biological systems find alternative pathways to achieve morphological goals. When constraints or failures block direct routes to optimal resource allocation, the system discovers alternative paths to the same goal.

## Planned features

### Core mechanisms

- **Configuration space navigation** - Explore possible resource allocations
- **Alternative path discovery** - Find new routes when blocked
- **Constraint-aware pathfinding** - Navigate around limitations
- **Gradient-based optimization** - Move toward resource goals

### Use cases

- **Dynamic resource allocation** - Adapt compute/memory/bandwidth distribution
- **Failure recovery** - Reroute around resource failures
- **Load balancing** - Navigate to optimal load distribution
- **Constraint satisfaction** - Find allocations meeting all requirements

## Conceptual example

```go
// Future API (subject to change)
import "github.com/carlisia/bio-adapt/navigate"

// Create navigator for resource allocation
navigator := navigate.NewNavigator(100, navigate.State{
    Target: navigate.ResourceGoal{
        CPU: 0.7,
        Memory: 0.6,
        Network: 0.5,
    },
    Constraints: navigate.Constraints{
        MaxCPU: 0.9,
        MinLatency: 10 * time.Millisecond,
    },
})

// Navigate to target allocation via best available path
navigator.NavigateToTarget(ctx)
```

## Research foundation

Based on:

- Goal-directed pathfinding in configuration spaces
- Multi-objective optimization with constraints
- Alternative path discovery algorithms
- Adaptive resource allocation strategies

## Current status

This package is under active development. Core concepts are being refined and the API is being designed.
