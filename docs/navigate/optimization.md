# Navigate optimization guide

## Overview

The navigate package will be optimized for efficient pathfinding and resource allocation in high-dimensional configuration spaces. These optimizations will enable real-time navigation for production systems with complex constraints.

## Planned optimizations

### 1. Dimension reduction

For high-dimensional resource spaces, intelligent dimension reduction will dramatically improve performance.

**Challenge:** Curse of dimensionality - exponential growth with dimensions.

**Solution:** Adaptive dimension reduction techniques:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for linear relationships
- Manifold learning for nonlinear spaces
- Feature selection based on goal relevance

**Expected results:**

- Search space: O(2^n) → O(2^k) where k << n
- Memory: Reduced by factor of n/k
- Convergence: 10-100x faster for high dimensions

### 2. Path caching and reuse

Memory of successful paths for similar navigation problems.

**Implementation approach:**

- LRU cache of recent paths
- Path similarity metrics
- Adaptive path refinement

**Benefits:**

- Amortized O(1) for repeated navigations
- Reduced exploration overhead
- Learning from historical patterns

### 3. Parallel exploration

Concurrent exploration of multiple paths.

**Optimization targets:**

- Parallel tree expansion (RRT\*)
- Distributed gradient descent
- Concurrent constraint checking

**Expected improvements:**

- Near-linear speedup with cores
- Faster constraint satisfaction
- Reduced time to first solution

## Performance projections

### Scalability estimates

| Dimensions | Agents | Path planning | Memory/agent | Total memory |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 5          | 100    | <5ms          | ~2KB         | ~200KB       |
| 10         | 100    | ~20ms         | ~4KB         | ~400KB       |
| 50         | 100    | ~100ms        | ~16KB        | ~1.6MB       |
| 100        | 100    | ~500ms        | ~32KB        | ~3.2MB       |

### Optimization triggers

The system will automatically optimize based on:

- Dimensions > 20 → Dimension reduction
- Repeated goals → Path caching
- Multi-core available → Parallel exploration
- Sparse constraints → Constraint indexing

## Memory layout

### Navigator structure (planned)

```go
// Optimized for cache efficiency
type Navigator struct {
    // Hot data (64 bytes - one cache line)
    position    [8]float32  // Current resource vector (8D)
    velocity    [8]float32  // Movement direction

    // Path memory (separate cache line)
    recentPaths []Path      // LRU cache
    pathIndex   map[uint64]int // Hash index

    // Constraints (cold data)
    constraints []Constraint
    goals       []Goal
}
```

### Space structure (planned)

```go
type ConfigurationSpace struct {
    // Dimension management
    dimensions   int
    bounds       []Bound

    // Efficient constraint representation
    constraints  ConstraintTree // Spatial indexing

    // Path cache
    pathCache    *LRUCache
    similarity   SimilarityIndex
}
```

## Navigation optimization

### A\* with adaptive heuristics

Intelligent path planning:

- Dynamic heuristic adjustment
- Constraint-aware cost functions
- Early termination on good-enough solutions

### Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT\*)

For high-dimensional spaces:

- Biased sampling toward goals
- Rewiring for path optimization
- Parallel tree growth

## Constraint handling

### Constraint indexing

Spatial data structures for fast constraint checking:

- R-trees for box constraints
- KD-trees for point constraints
- Interval trees for range constraints

Benefits:

- O(log n) constraint checking
- Pruning of infeasible regions
- Early termination of invalid paths

### Lazy constraint evaluation

Defer expensive constraint checks:

- Check simple constraints first
- Batch constraint evaluation
- Progressive refinement

## Parallel processing

### Work distribution strategies

```go
// Parallel exploration
type ParallelNavigator struct {
    workers     []*Worker
    workQueue   chan ExplorationTask
    resultQueue chan Path
}
```

### GPU acceleration (future)

Potential GPU optimizations:

- Parallel gradient computation
- Batch constraint evaluation
- Monte Carlo path sampling

## Benchmarking strategy

### Key metrics

```bash
# Path planning speed
benchmark_path_planning_time

# Constraint satisfaction rate
benchmark_constraint_success_rate

# Memory efficiency
benchmark_memory_per_dimension

# Path quality
benchmark_path_optimality_ratio
```

### Performance targets

- Path planning: <100ms for 50 dimensions
- First solution: <10ms for feasible problems
- Memory overhead: <1KB per dimension
- Path efficiency: Within 1.5x optimal
