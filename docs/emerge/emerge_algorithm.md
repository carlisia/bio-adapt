# The Emerge Algorithm

## Overview

Emerge is a decentralized synchronization algorithm based on the Kuramoto model from physics. It enables independent [agents](../concepts/agents.md) to achieve coordinated behavior through local interactions, without [central control](decentralization.md). The algorithm is inspired by natural synchronization phenomena like firefly flashing, cardiac pacemaker cells, and circadian rhythms.

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Kuramoto Model

At its core, emerge implements a variant of the Kuramoto model, which describes the synchronization of coupled oscillators:

```
dθᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + (K/N) × Σⱼ sin(θⱼ - θᵢ)
```

Where:

- **θᵢ** = [phase](../concepts/phase.md) of oscillator i (0 to 2π)
- **ωᵢ** = natural [frequency](../concepts/frequency.md) of oscillator i
- **K** = coupling strength
- **N** = number of neighbors
- **Σⱼ** = sum over all neighbors j

### Key Insight

The algorithm's power comes from a simple principle: agents adjust their phase based on the average influence of their neighbors. When enough agents do this simultaneously, global synchronization emerges from local interactions.

## Algorithm Components

### 1. Agent State

Each agent maintains:

```
Agent {
    Phase:      float64  // Position in cycle (0 to 2π) - see [Phase](../concepts/phase.md)
    Frequency:  float64  // Rate of phase change - see [Frequency](../concepts/frequency.md)
    Energy:     float64  // Resource for adjustments - see [Energy](../concepts/energy.md)
    Neighbors:  []Agent  // Observable agents
}
```

### 2. Update Rules

The algorithm proceeds in discrete time steps:

```
for each timestep:
    for each agent:
        1. Observe neighbor phases
        2. Calculate phase difference
        3. Compute adjustment force
        4. Apply adjustment (if energy available)
        5. Update energy
        6. Advance phase by frequency
```

### 3. Phase Adjustment

The core synchronization logic:

```go
// Calculate coupling force
force := 0.0
for _, neighbor := range agent.Neighbors {
    phaseDiff := neighbor.Phase - agent.Phase
    force += sin(phaseDiff)
}
force = force / len(agent.Neighbors)

// Apply adjustment
adjustment := couplingStrength * force * deltaTime
agent.Phase += adjustment
agent.Energy -= abs(adjustment) * energyCost
```

## Algorithmic Strategies

Emerge extends the basic Kuramoto model with multiple [strategies](../concepts/strategies.md) that agents can switch between according to the [protocol](protocol.md):

### PhaseNudge Strategy

```
adjustment = α × mean(neighbor_phases - my_phase)
where α is small (0.01-0.1)
```

- Gentle, incremental adjustments
- Energy efficient
- Slow but stable convergence

### FrequencyLock Strategy

```
Step 1: frequency_adjustment = β × mean(neighbor_frequencies - my_frequency)
Step 2: phase_adjustment = α × mean(neighbor_phases - my_phase)
```

- First aligns frequencies, then phases
- Two-stage synchronization
- Handles heterogeneous systems

### PulseCoupling Strategy

```
if phase crosses threshold:
    send_pulse_to_neighbors(strength=γ)

on_receive_pulse:
    phase = min(phase + pulse_strength, 2π)
```

- Discrete, strong adjustments
- Based on integrate-and-fire neurons
- Fast but energy-intensive

### EnergyAware Strategy

```
if energy > high_threshold:
    adjustment = large_coupling * phase_difference
elif energy > low_threshold:
    adjustment = small_coupling * phase_difference
else:
    adjustment = 0  // conserve energy
```

- Adaptive based on resources
- Sustainable for long-running systems
- Prevents energy depletion

## Convergence Properties

### Order Parameter

The algorithm's convergence is measured by the Kuramoto order parameter ([coherence](../concepts/coherence.md)):

```
r × e^(iψ) = (1/N) × Σⱼ e^(iθⱼ)
```

Where:

- **r** = coherence (0 to 1)
- **ψ** = mean phase
- **θⱼ** = phase of agent j

### Critical Coupling

Synchronization occurs when coupling strength exceeds a critical value:

```
Kc = 2/(π × g(0))
```

Where g(0) is the peak of the frequency distribution.

### Convergence Time

Typical convergence follows:

```
T_sync ∝ log(N) / K
```

Meaning convergence time scales logarithmically with system size.

## Algorithm Optimizations

### 1. Atomic Operations

For concurrent access in multi-threaded environments:

```go
type AtomicState struct {
    phase     atomic.Uint64  // Stored as fixed-point
    frequency atomic.Uint64
    energy    atomic.Uint64
}
```

### 2. Neighbor Storage

Efficient neighbor management for large swarms:

```go
type OptimizedNeighbors struct {
    indices []int32         // Compact storage
    pool    *sync.Pool      // Reuse allocations
}
```

### 3. Batch Updates

Update multiple agents in parallel:

```go
parallel_for(agents, num_workers) {
    update_agent_phase()
    update_agent_energy()
}
```

### 4. Adaptive Time Steps

Adjust update frequency based on convergence rate:

```
if coherence_change < threshold:
    increase_timestep()
else:
    decrease_timestep()
```

## Goal-Directed Behavior

The algorithm adapts its parameters based on [goals](../concepts/goals.md) - see [Goal-Directed Synchronization](goal-directed.md) for details:

### For Synchronization (MinimizeAPICalls)

- Target coherence: 0.85-0.95
- High coupling strength
- Positive phase coupling
- Strategy: PulseCoupling or FrequencyLock

### For Anti-Synchronization (DistributeLoad)

- Target coherence: 0.1-0.3
- Negative coupling (repulsion)
- Phase distribution objective
- Strategy: PhaseNudge with repulsion

### For Partial Synchronization (ReachConsensus)

- Target coherence: 0.5-0.7
- Medium coupling
- Cluster formation
- Strategy: FrequencyLock with groups

## Algorithm Complexity

### Time Complexity

- Per agent update: O(k) where k = number of neighbors
- Full swarm update: O(N × k)
- With full connectivity: O(N²)
- With sparse topology: O(N)

### Space Complexity

- Agent storage: O(N)
- Neighbor lists: O(N × k)
- Total: O(N × k)

### Communication Complexity

- Local topology: O(k) messages per agent
- Full mesh: O(N) messages per agent
- Per timestep total: O(N × k)

## Robustness Properties

### Fault Tolerance

The algorithm continues functioning despite [disruptions](disruption.md):

- Agent failures (up to 50% loss)
- Communication delays
- Noise in observations
- Dynamic topology changes

### Self-Stabilization

From any initial state, the system converges to the goal:

```
∀ initial_state: eventually(coherence → target_coherence)
```

### Adaptability

The algorithm adjusts to:

- Changing network topology
- Variable agent frequencies
- External perturbations
- Resource constraints

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Numerical Stability

Prevent phase wraparound issues:

```go
func normalizePhase(phase float64) float64 {
    for phase > 2*π {
        phase -= 2*π
    }
    for phase < 0 {
        phase += 2*π
    }
    return phase
}
```

### 2. Concurrency Control

Thread-safe updates:

```go
func (a *Agent) UpdatePhase(delta float64) {
    for {
        old := a.phase.Load()
        new := normalizePhase(old + delta)
        if a.phase.CompareAndSwap(old, new) {
            break
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Energy Management

Prevent deadlock from energy depletion:

```go
if swarm.AverageEnergy() < critical_threshold {
    increase_recovery_rate()
    reduce_coupling_strength()
}
```

- **Token Ring**: Sequential, one agent at a time
- **Use emerge when**: Need parallel action, not sequential

### vs. Master-Slave

- **Emerge**: Fully decentralized, no single point of failure
- **Master-Slave**: Centralized control, single point of failure
- **Use emerge when**: Need resilience and scalability

### vs. Gossip Protocols

- **Emerge**: Deterministic convergence to specific states
- **Gossip**: Probabilistic information spread
- **Use emerge when**: Need precise synchronization, not just information sharing

## Mathematical Proofs

### Convergence Proof (Simplified)

Given:

- Coupling K > Kc (critical coupling)
- Connected network topology
- Bounded frequency distribution

Then:

1. Define Lyapunov function: V = Σᵢⱼ (1 - cos(θᵢ - θⱼ))
2. Show dV/dt ≤ 0 (energy decreases)
3. V = 0 only when all phases equal
4. Therefore system converges to synchronization

### Stability Analysis

The synchronized state is locally stable when:

```
λmax < 0
```

Where λmax is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized system Jacobian.

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability

| Agents | Convergence Time | Memory | CPU Usage |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------ | --------- |
| 20     | ~1 second        | 100KB  | 1%        |
| 200    | ~5 seconds       | 1MB    | 5%        |
| 2000   | ~30 seconds      | 10MB   | 20%       |
| 20000  | ~3 minutes       | 100MB  | 80%       |
