# Use Cases for Emerge

## Overview

This document presents real-world scenarios where emerge excels, complete with problem descriptions, solutions, code examples, and expected outcomes. Each use case shows how emerge's [decentralized](decentralization.md) [synchronization](../concepts/synchronization.md) solves actual problems better than traditional approaches. See [Alternatives](alternatives.md) for comparisons with other solutions.

## 1. 🌐 API Rate Limit Optimization

### The Problem

Your SaaS platform has 200 microservices making calls to an expensive third-party API with a rate limit of 100 requests per second. Without coordination, services hit rate limits and get throttled.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Central rate limiter**: Single point of failure, added latency
- **Fixed time slots**: Wastes capacity, rigid scheduling
- **Token bucket**: Complex distributed state management

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Each microservice runs this
client := emerge.MinimizeAPICalls(scale.Medium)  // See [Goals](../concepts/goals.md)
client.Start(ctx)

func (s *Service) CallExpensiveAPI(data []Request) {
    // Accumulate requests
    s.pendingRequests = append(s.pendingRequests, data...)

    // Wait for synchronization
    if client.IsConverged() && len(s.pendingRequests) > 0 {
        // All services batch at the same time
        batch := s.createBatch(s.pendingRequests)
        response := s.apiClient.BatchCall(batch)
        s.processBatchResponse(response)
        s.pendingRequests = nil
    }
}
```

### Results

- **80% reduction** in API calls through batching
- **No rate limit violations** - synchronized services stay under limit
- **Resilient** - continues working even if some services fail
- **Cost savings** - Fewer API calls = lower bills

### Timeline

```
Before Emerge:
Service A: --x--x--x--x--x-- (many individual calls)
Service B: -x--x--x--x--x--- (hitting rate limits)
Service C: ---x--x--x--x--x- (getting throttled)

With Emerge:
Service A: --------XXXX----- (batched calls)
Service B: --------XXXX----- (synchronized)
Service C: --------XXXX----- (under rate limit)
```

## 2. 🔋 IoT Sensor Network Power Management

### The Problem

You have 1000 battery-powered sensors that need to report data while maximizing battery life. Constant reporting drains batteries, but you need regular updates.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Always-on**: Batteries die in days
- **Fixed schedule**: Wastes energy, misses events
- **Central coordinator**: Doesn't scale, single point of failure

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Each sensor runs this
client := emerge.SaveEnergy(scale.Large)
client.Start(ctx)

type Sensor struct {
    batteryLevel float64
    data         []Reading
}

func (s *Sensor) ManagePower() {
    for {
        // Collect readings with minimal power
        s.collectData()

        // Synchronize for batch transmission
        if client.IsConverged() && s.batteryLevel > 20 {
            // All sensors transmit together
            s.transmitData()  // High power operation
            s.enterSleepMode()  // Save energy
        }

        // Sparse activity pattern
        time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
    }
}
```

### Results

- **10x battery life** improvement
- **Predictable data collection** windows
- **Adaptive to battery levels** - low battery sensors conserve more
- **Self-organizing** - no central coordinator needed

### Power Profile

```
Traditional (Always-on):
Battery: 100% ████████████████████
Day 1:    80% ████████████████
Day 2:    60% ████████████
Day 3:    40% ████████
Day 4:    20% ████
Day 5:     0% Dead

Emerge (Synchronized):
Battery: 100% ████████████████████
Week 1:   90% ██████████████████
Week 2:   80% ████████████████
Week 3:   70% ██████████████
Week 4:   60% ████████████
```

## 3. 💰 Cryptocurrency Trading Bot Coordination

### The Problem

You run 50 trading bots across different exchanges. When they all try to execute trades simultaneously, they cause slippage and compete against each other, reducing profits.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Market impact**: Bots compete, moving prices against you
- **Slippage**: Simultaneous orders cause price movements
- **Complexity**: Managing inter-bot communication

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Coordinate bots to trade at different times
client := emerge.DistributeLoad(scale.Small)
client.Start(ctx)

type TradingBot struct {
    exchange string
    strategy Strategy
}

func (bot *TradingBot) ExecuteTrades() {
    for {
        opportunity := bot.strategy.FindOpportunity()

        if opportunity != nil {
            // Anti-synchronize to avoid competition
            if client.Coherence() < 0.3 {  // Well distributed
                // Each bot trades at different times
                bot.executeTrade(opportunity)
                log.Printf("Bot %s executed trade", bot.exchange)
            }
        }

        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```

### Results

- **30% reduction** in slippage
- **Better fill prices** - bots don't compete
- **Market impact minimized** - trades distributed over time
- **Higher profits** - less self-competition

### Trading Distribution

```
Without Emerge (All bots trade together):
Exchange A: ████████ (high slippage)
Exchange B: ████████ (competing bids)
Exchange C: ████████ (moving market)
Impact: -$5000 per day from self-competition

With Emerge (Distributed timing):
Exchange A: ██  ██  ██  ██ (spread out)
Exchange B:   ██  ██  ██   (no competition)
Exchange C: ██  ██  ██  ██ (minimal impact)
Impact: +$3000 per day from better fills
```

## 4. 🎮 Multiplayer Game State Synchronization

### The Problem

Your multiplayer game needs to synchronize events across 100 players with minimal latency. Traditional client-server architecture introduces lag and doesn't scale well.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Server bottleneck**: All updates go through server
- **Latency**: Round-trip to server for every action
- **Scaling costs**: More players = bigger servers

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Each game client runs this
client := emerge.MinimizeLatency(scale.Tiny)
client.Start(ctx)

type GameClient struct {
    playerID string
    state    GameState
}

func (gc *GameClient) SyncGameEvents() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(50 * time.Millisecond)  // 20 FPS

    for range ticker.C {
        // Quick synchronization for real-time feel
        if client.IsConverged() {
            // All players update together
            gc.processLocalInputs()
            gc.broadcastState()
            gc.renderFrame()
        }
    }
}
```

### Results

- **<100ms latency** for state sync
- **Smooth gameplay** - synchronized frame updates
- **P2P architecture** - reduced server costs
- **Scales horizontally** - add players without server upgrades

### Latency Comparison

```
Client-Server:
Player → Server → Other Players = 150ms average

Emerge P2P:
Player ←→ Nearby Players = 50ms average

Perceived Responsiveness:
Traditional: "Laggy", "Rubber-banding"
Emerge: "Smooth", "Responsive"
```

## 5. 🏭 Manufacturing Line Coordination

### The Problem

Your factory has 20 robotic stations that need to coordinate for efficient production flow. Without synchronization, bottlenecks form and throughput drops.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Central PLC**: Expensive, single point of failure
- **Fixed timing**: Can't adapt to variations
- **Complex programming**: Ladder logic maintenance nightmare

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Each robot station runs this
client := emerge.MaintainRhythm(scale.Tiny)
client.Start(ctx)

type RobotStation struct {
    stationID int
    workQueue []WorkItem
}

func (rs *RobotStation) ProcessItems() {
    for {
        // Maintain steady production rhythm
        if client.IsConverged() {
            if len(rs.workQueue) > 0 {
                item := rs.workQueue[0]
                rs.processWorkItem(item)
                rs.passToNextStation(item)
                rs.workQueue = rs.workQueue[1:]
            }
        }

        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)  // Production beat
    }
}
```

### Results

- **25% throughput increase** - optimal flow
- **Reduced bottlenecks** - stations stay synchronized
- **Adaptive pacing** - adjusts to slowest station
- **Simplified maintenance** - no complex PLC logic

### Production Flow

```
Uncoordinated:
Station 1: ████    ████    ████ (waiting)
Station 2:     ████████      ██ (bottleneck)
Station 3:   ████  ████  ████   (irregular)
Output: 120 units/hour

Emerge Synchronized:
Station 1: ████ ████ ████ ████ (steady)
Station 2: ████ ████ ████ ████ (matched)
Station 3: ████ ████ ████ ████ (smooth)
Output: 150 units/hour
```

## 6. 🚗 Autonomous Vehicle Intersection Management

### The Problem

Self-driving cars approaching an intersection need to coordinate crossing without traffic lights or central control.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Traffic lights**: Fixed timing, inefficient
- **Central controller**: Single point of failure, latency
- **Complex negotiation**: Vehicles must communicate extensively

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Each vehicle runs this
client := emerge.ReachConsensus(scale.Small)
client.Start(ctx)

type AutonomousVehicle struct {
    vehicleID string
    position  Position
    intention Intention  // straight, left, right
}

func (av *AutonomousVehicle) ApproachIntersection() {
    // Form consensus on crossing order
    for !av.hasPassedIntersection() {
        distance := av.distanceToIntersection()

        if distance < 50 && client.IsConverged() {
            // Vehicles reach consensus on order
            crossingOrder := av.calculateCrossingOrder()

            if av.isMyTurn(crossingOrder) {
                av.crossIntersection()
            } else {
                av.adjustSpeed()  // Slow down or speed up
            }
        }

        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```

### Results

- **40% reduction** in wait times
- **No collisions** - consensus prevents conflicts
- **Smooth traffic flow** - no stop-and-go
- **Works without infrastructure** - no traffic lights needed

### Traffic Pattern

```
Traditional Traffic Light:
North: ████STOP████STOP████
South: ████STOP████STOP████
East:  STOP████STOP████STOP
West:  STOP████STOP████STOP
Average wait: 45 seconds

Emerge Coordination:
North: ███ ███ ███ ███ (continuous flow)
South: ███ ███ ███ ███ (coordinated gaps)
East:   ███ ███ ███ ███ (smooth merging)
West:   ███ ███ ███ ███ (no full stops)
Average wait: 27 seconds
```

## 7. 📊 Distributed Data Processing Pipeline

### The Problem

Your data pipeline has 200 workers processing streams. Uncoordinated checkpointing causes performance hiccups and storage spikes.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Checkpoint storms**: All workers checkpoint simultaneously
- **Storage overload**: Sudden write spikes
- **Recovery complexity**: Inconsistent checkpoint times

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Coordinate checkpointing across workers
client := emerge.Custom().
    WithGoal(goal.MinimizeAPICalls).  // Treat checkpoints like API calls
    WithScale(scale.Medium).
    WithTargetCoherence(0.9).
    Build()

client.Start(ctx)

type DataWorker struct {
    workerID   string
    checkpoint Checkpoint
    processed  int64
}

func (dw *DataWorker) ProcessStream(stream DataStream) {
    for data := range stream {
        dw.processData(data)
        dw.processed++

        // Coordinate checkpointing
        if dw.processed%1000 == 0 && client.IsConverged() {
            // All workers checkpoint together
            dw.saveCheckpoint()
            log.Printf("Worker %s checkpointed at %d",
                      dw.workerID, dw.processed)
        }
    }
}
```

### Results

- **50% reduction** in storage IOPS spikes
- **Consistent recovery points** across workers
- **Predictable performance** - no random hiccups
- **Simplified recovery** - all checkpoints aligned

### Checkpoint Timeline

```
Uncoordinated:
Storage IOPS: ▁█▂▁▁█▁▃█▁▁▂█▁ (random spikes)
Performance:  ▅▁▄▅▅▁▅▃▁▅▅▂▁▅ (unpredictable)

Emerge Coordinated:
Storage IOPS: ▁▁▁█▁▁▁█▁▁▁█▁▁ (predictable)
Performance:  ▅▅▅▃▅▅▅▃▅▅▅▃▅▅ (consistent)
```

## 8. 🏥 Hospital Equipment Maintenance Scheduling

### The Problem

A hospital has 500 medical devices requiring periodic maintenance. Uncoordinated maintenance causes equipment shortages and staff overtime.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Manual scheduling**: Error-prone, time-consuming
- **Fixed schedules**: Doesn't adapt to usage patterns
- **Equipment conflicts**: Multiple devices offline simultaneously

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Distribute maintenance to avoid conflicts
client := emerge.AdaptToTraffic(scale.Large)
client.Start(ctx)

type MedicalDevice struct {
    deviceID    string
    deviceType  string
    usageHours  int
    maintenance MaintenanceSchedule
}

func (md *MedicalDevice) ScheduleMaintenance() {
    for {
        if md.needsMaintenance() {
            // Adapt to hospital traffic patterns
            if client.Coherence() < 0.4 {  // Well distributed
                // Schedule during low-usage periods
                md.scheduleWindow = md.findNextWindow()
                md.notifyMaintenanceTeam()
                log.Printf("Device %s scheduled for %v",
                          md.deviceID, md.scheduleWindow)
            }
        }

        time.Sleep(1 * time.Hour)
    }
}
```

### Results

- **Zero equipment conflicts** - maintenance distributed
- **30% reduction** in overtime costs
- **Better equipment availability** - strategic scheduling
- **Adaptive to usage** - responds to patterns

### Maintenance Distribution

```
Traditional (Conflicting schedules):
MRI Units:     ████    ████     (both offline)
Ventilators:      ████████      (shortage!)
X-Ray:         ████████         (multiple down)
Staff stress: HIGH, Equipment availability: 60%

Emerge (Distributed maintenance):
MRI Units:     ██        ██     (staggered)
Ventilators:      ██  ██  ██    (always available)
X-Ray:         ██    ██    ██   (distributed)
Staff stress: LOW, Equipment availability: 85%
```

## 9. 🌍 Content Delivery Network (CDN) Cache Refresh

### The Problem

Your CDN has 100 edge servers that need to refresh cached content. Simultaneous refreshes overload origin servers and cause cache misses.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Origin overload**: All edges pull simultaneously
- **Cache thundering herd**: Mass invalidation causes misses
- **Bandwidth spikes**: Network congestion

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Coordinate cache refreshes
client := emerge.Custom().
    WithGoal(goal.MinimizeAPICalls).
    WithScale(scale.Medium).
    WithTargetCoherence(0.7).  // Partial sync for gradual refresh
    Build()

client.Start(ctx)

type EdgeServer struct {
    serverID string
    cache    Cache
    origin   OriginServer
}

func (es *EdgeServer) RefreshCache() {
    for {
        staleContent := es.cache.GetStaleContent()

        if len(staleContent) > 0 {
            // Coordinate refresh timing
            coherence := client.Coherence()

            // Gradual refresh based on coherence
            if coherence > 0.5 && coherence < 0.8 {
                // Refresh in waves, not all at once
                es.refreshContent(staleContent)
                log.Printf("Edge %s refreshed %d items",
                          es.serverID, len(staleContent))
            }
        }

        time.Sleep(30 * time.Second)
    }
}
```

### Results

- **90% reduction** in origin server spikes
- **Smooth bandwidth usage** - no congestion
- **Better cache hit rates** - gradual invalidation
- **Improved user experience** - fewer cache misses

### Origin Server Load

```
Traditional (Thundering herd):
Origin Load: ▁▁▁▁█████▁▁▁▁█████▁▁▁ (massive spikes)
Cache Hits:  ████▁▁▁▁▁████▁▁▁▁▁████ (drops to zero)
Bandwidth:   ▁▁▁▁█████▁▁▁▁█████▁▁▁ (network congestion)

Emerge (Coordinated refresh):
Origin Load: ▂▂▂▃▄▄▄▃▂▂▂▃▄▄▄▃▂▂▂ (smooth waves)
Cache Hits:  ████████▇▇████████▇▇██ (maintained)
Bandwidth:   ▃▃▃▄▄▅▅▄▄▃▃▃▄▄▅▅▄▄▃▃ (distributed)
```

## 10. 🎵 Distributed Music Performance

### The Problem

Musicians in different locations want to play together online, but network latency makes traditional synchronization impossible.

### Traditional Approach Problems

- **Network latency**: 50-200ms delays break timing
- **Jitter**: Variable delays make it worse
- **Complexity**: Requires expensive specialized hardware

### Emerge Solution

```go
// Musicians synchronize to a shared beat
client := emerge.MaintainRhythm(scale.Tiny)
client.Start(ctx)

type Musician struct {
    instrument string
    tempo      int  // BPM
    latency    time.Duration
}

func (m *Musician) PlayMusic(score MusicScore) {
    // Compensate for network latency
    m.measureLatency()

    beatInterval := time.Minute / time.Duration(m.tempo)
    ticker := time.NewTicker(beatInterval)

    for beat := range ticker.C {
        if client.IsConverged() {
            // All musicians on same beat despite latency
            nextNote := score.GetNote(beat)

            // Play slightly ahead to compensate for latency
            m.playWithCompensation(nextNote, m.latency)
        }
    }
}
```

### Results

- **Synchronized performance** despite latency
- **No specialized hardware** required
- **Adaptive to network conditions**
- **Musicians stay in rhythm**

### Performance Quality

```
Traditional (Direct play with latency):
Musician A: ♪  ♪  ♪  ♪  (on time)
Musician B:  ♪  ♪  ♪  ♪ (50ms behind)
Musician C:   ♪  ♪  ♪  (100ms behind)
Result: Cacophony, unplayable

Emerge (Synchronized with compensation):
Musician A: ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (adjusted)
Musician B: ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (synchronized)
Musician C: ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (in rhythm)
Result: Harmonious, ensemble playing
```
